A repository holding some kernels I've been playing about with.

## Diffusion Net

This is a model architecture from https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.00888 and works pretty well on
3D mesh data.

Kernels for first two layers can be found here:
- [spatial_diffusion](spatial_diffusion/README.md)
- [spatial_gradients](spatial_gradients/README.md)
